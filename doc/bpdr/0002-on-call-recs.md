1. On-call recommendations 
Date: 2022-03-10

Status
Accepted

Context
18F recently built an emergent website that needed on-call support from non-team members. 
Because of the urgency of the situation, the on-call needs were left to the last minute.

Meanwhile, 18F is moving towards being more product-focused, and as such, we may need
to support products in the long- or short-term going forward.

Decision
[On-call recommendations](https://engineering.18f.gov/on-call/) were created by Davida Marion,
under consultation with Christa Hartsock and Logan McDonald. Recommendations were 
[reviewed by](https://github.com/18F/development-guide/pull/298):
Jessica Dussault, Laura Gerhardt, Alex Soble, Michael Sullivan, Neil Martinsen-Burrell,
Ryan Ahern, Sarah Withee, and Sven Aas.

Consequences
Engineers have a reviewed set of recommendations to take into account while working on builds
that seem like they may have on-call needs. These recommendations can be inserted into the 
staffing phase, the development phase, and the support phase.
