Accepted

Context
As we make best practices decisions, it would be good to have a record
of those decisions so that people can understand the historical context
and review/revisit whether the circumstances of those decisions are still
appropriate.

Decision
We will use Best Practices Decision Records (BPDR), modified from Architecture Decision
Records (ADR) [as described by Michael Nygard](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

Consequences
Best practices decisions are available in a consistent format to help explain the 
reasons and motivations behind creating a best practice.
